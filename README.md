# robocik-www-legacy

This is the legacy version of Robocik's website, later succeeded by [robocik-webdev/www](https://github.com/robocik-webdev/www).

The crucial idea behind the design was to show a drone seemingly going deeper underwater as you scroll, which was achieved using a parallax effect with multiple shapes creating the illusion of moving water.
